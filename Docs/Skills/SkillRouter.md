# Skill Router

Use this first when deciding which MonitorBaseClaude mini skill applies. Load the smallest card that matches the active work instead of loading the whole documentation set.

## Before Routing

Confirm task type from get_workflow_status output or the user's task description before selecting cards. If task type is unclear, load RoslynFirstNavigation.md only and route after the first tool results.

## Routing

- Semantic discovery: `RoslynFirstNavigation.md`
- Watched-source edits: `SystemMonitorStaging.md`
- Coupled multi-file staging/compile: `SessionOverlayValidation.md`
- WinMerge/review/queue block behavior: `ReviewQueueAndGates.md`
- Adding, replacing, or removing C# symbols: `FormattingOracle.md`
- Async/signature/API caller propagation: `AsyncPropagation.md`
- Human-guided companion partial extraction: `PartialClassRefactor.md`
- New Razor component authoring (markup + companion partial class): see CLAUDE.md "Razor Files" — start in two-file form, do not author with inline `@code`.
- Live tool-traffic verification or debugging: `TroubleshootingDashboard.md`

## Layering

- Tool descriptions answer: how do I call this tool right now?
- Mini skills answer: what operating mode am I in?
- Long docs and fixture corpus answer: why does this rule exist, and what proved it?

## Rule

Do not load every card by default. Start with the router, then add only the cards required by the task.
