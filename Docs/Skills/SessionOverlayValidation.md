# Session Overlay Validation

Use for coupled multi-file C# edits.

## Rule

Compose and stage every coupled file in the same monitor session before the first review launch. Overlay compilation must see the proposed files together, even though WinMerge review is serial.

## Flow

```text
start_monitor_session
compose Working candidate A with sessionId
stage_candidate_for_review for file A with sessionId
compose Working candidate B with sessionId
stage_candidate_for_review for file B with sessionId
review overlayValidation results
launch/review file A
record decision for file A
launch/review file B
record decision for file B
check final IndexRefresh status before relying on solution-index queries
```

## Do Not

- Do not review file A before composing and staging coupled file B.
- Do not treat a clean single-file overlay as enough when another staged file is required for the feature to compile.
- Do not let empty reference results shrink the session by themselves; cross-check before deciding a change is single-file.
- Do not continue to later diffs if an earlier staged item is blocked by validation or review-gate state.
- Do not run manual index refresh tools after each accepted file in a coupled chain; let `record_diff_decision` perform the single rebuild when the chain is complete unless it reports a refresh failure.

## Unblock

- Stage a corrected candidate for the same blocked file.
- If diagnostics identify a missed consumer/call site, add that file to the same monitor session and stage it before retrying review.
- Or explicitly force-review the blocked item through the Host UI.
- Or abandon the chain and start a new monitor session for unrelated work.
